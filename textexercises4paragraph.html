<font face = "Tahoma">  Once upon a time, there was a woodcutter, who lived in a little house in a
beautiful, green wood. </font>
<font face = "Vienna"> One day, he was merrily chopping some wood, when he saw a little girl skipping
through the woods, whistling happily, followed by a big grey wolf</font>
<font face = "P152">  Deciding it was really none of his business, the woodcutter went back to chopping
wood, until he heard a scream! </font>
<font face = "Xenotron Normal">  He grabbed his axe and ran towards the noise, where he found that he was too
late: the big grey wolf had already eaten the little girl and her granny. </font>
<font face = "Planet Space"> And the moral of this story is: all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do
nothing. </font>
