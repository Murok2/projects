<u>Gone With the Wind</u> is the famous and controversial American
novel by American writer,<u> Margaret Mitchell</u>. Here, she draws
us into the lives and experiences of myriad colorful
characters during (and after) the <b><i>Civil War.</i></b>
Like <b><i>William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet</i></b>, <u>Mitchell</u> paints
a romantic tale of star-crossed lovers, torn apart and
brought back together--through the tragedies and comedies
of human existence.
